# challenges
Some challenges for the group based on what we went over at the last meetup. 

1. Modify the data scraped to return the date the review was published, the title of the book, and a description of the book if there is one.
2. Figure out how to save these using any data structure where you can write them to a csv or json object for later analysis.
  EX { books: { title:
                date_published:
                description: 
                }
 3. Figure out how to get other pages of the site, and automate the url generation so you don't have to hard code it.
